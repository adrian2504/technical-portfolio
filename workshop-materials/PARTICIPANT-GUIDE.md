# Technical Portfolio Workshop - Participant Guide

## Welcome! 🎉

In the next 90 minutes, you'll build a professional technical portfolio website that showcases your skills, projects, and experience.

---

## Workshop Structure

### Phase 1: Build Together (40 minutes)
**Everyone follows along with the instructor**

We'll build your core portfolio manually:
- ✅ Homepage with your name and professional summary
- ✅ About page with your background and skills
- ✅ Projects page with 3 of your projects

**Goal:** Everyone leaves with a working 3-page portfolio

### Phase 2: Enhance (15 minutes)
**Choose your track based on your tools and preferences**

**Track A - AI Enhancement:**
- For those with AI coding assistants (Q Developer, Copilot, etc.)
- Use AI to improve content quality
- Generate better descriptions and polish

**Track B - Manual Polish:**
- For everyone else (or if AI isn't working)
- Add contact information
- Refine descriptions
- Customize colors

**Both tracks lead to success!**

---

## Setup Steps 

### Step 1: Get Your Copy
```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/kandyce1010/technical-portfolio.git
cd technical-portfolio
```

### Step 2: Create Your Working Directory
```bash
# Create your working directory from templates
cp -r templates my-portfolio
```

### Step 3: Open in Your Editor

Open the entire `technical-portfolio` folder in your text editor:
- This gives you access to your working files (my-portfolio/)
- Plus the instructor's example (instructor-example/) for reference
- Plus workshop guides (workshop-materials/) if you need them

**In VS Code:** File → Open Folder → Select `technical-portfolio`

**Note:** Later when you deploy, you'll only need the `my-portfolio/` folder contents. For now, having everything helps you learn!

### Step 4: Understand the Files

Your `my-portfolio/` folder contains these HTML files:

- **index.html** - Homepage (your name, title, summary)
- **about.html** - About page (background, skills, timeline)
- **projects.html** - Projects page (showcase your work)
- **blog.html** - Blog page (optional content)
- **contact.html** - Contact page (how to reach you)
- **styles.css** - Styling (colors, fonts, layout)

**During the workshop, you'll manually update these files with your content.**

### Step 5: Optional - AI Assistant Setup

If you have an AI coding assistant and want to use it for Phase 2 enhancements:

#### Option A: Q Developer with Portfolio Workflow Rules

**What this does:** Sets up Q Developer to guide you through building your portfolio with a structured workflow.

**Setup steps:**
```bash
# Create rules directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .amazonq/rules

# Copy the portfolio workflow rules
cp workshop-materials/q-developer-rules/portfolio-workflow.md .amazonq/rules/
```

**How to use it:**
1. Open Q Developer chat if not already using it. 
2. Say: "Help me build my technical portfolio"
3. Q Developer will guide you through a structured workflow:
   - Information gathering (your details)
   - Design preferences (colors, style)
   - Portfolio generation (creates your pages)
   - Review and refinement (polish your content)

#### Option B: Use AI for Phase 2 Enhancements Only

If you just want to use AI for Phase 2 content improvements (not the full workflow):
- No special setup needed
- Just use the prompts from AI-ENHANCEMENT-GUIDE.md during Phase 2


**Note:** AI tools are optional! 

### Step 6: Verify Setup
- Open `my-portfolio/index.html` in your browser
- You should see the template portfolio
- Navigation should work (hamburger menu on mobile)

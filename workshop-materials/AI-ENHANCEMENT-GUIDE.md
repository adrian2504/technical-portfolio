## Tips for Effective AI Enhancement

### Do's ✅
- **Start with your content:** AI enhances, doesn't create from scratch
- **Be specific:** Give context about your audience and goals
- **Iterate:** If first result isn't perfect, refine your prompt
- **Keep your voice:** Edit AI output to sound like you
- **Test readability:** Read it out loud - does it sound natural?

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't use AI-generated content verbatim:** Always personalize
- **Don't lose authenticity:** Your unique experiences matter
- **Don't over-polish:** Some personality is good
- **Don't forget to fact-check:** AI can be wrong about technical details
- **Don't rely on AI for everything:** Manual polish is valuable too

## Troubleshooting

**AI suggestions don't match my style:**
- Add "Write in a [casual/formal/technical] tone" to your prompt
- Edit the output to match your voice

**AI is too verbose:**
- Add "Keep it concise, maximum 2-3 sentences" to your prompt
- Manually trim the output

**AI doesn't understand context:**
- Provide more background in your prompt
- Break complex requests into smaller prompts

**AI tool isn't working:**
- Switch to manual polish (Track B)
- You already have a working portfolio!

---

## Remember

**The goal of Phase 2 is enhancement, not perfection.**

You already have a working portfolio from Phase 1. AI helps you polish and improve, but your content and authentic voice are what matter most.

If AI isn't helping or is taking too long, switch to manual polish - both tracks lead to success!

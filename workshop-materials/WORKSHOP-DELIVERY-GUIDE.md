## Instructor Tips for 90 Minutes

### Time Management
- **Set timers** - Announce time remaining at 30, 20, 10 min marks
- **Minimum viable portfolio** - 3 pages is success
- **Skip blog page** - Can add later
- **Use placeholders** - Images can be added after workshop

### Keep It Moving
- "Perfect is the enemy of done"
- "You can polish this later"
- "Let's get it working first"

### Common 90-Minute Pitfalls
❌ Spending too long on design/colors  
✅ Use template colors, customize later

❌ Trying to add all 5 pages  
✅ Focus on home, about, projects only

❌ Writing perfect content  
✅ Use worksheet content as-is, refine later

❌ Troubleshooting one person too long  
✅ "Let's get you on Path 1 to keep moving"

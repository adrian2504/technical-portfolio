## Instructor Management Tips

### Keep Everyone Moving Together (Phase 1)
- **Use timers:** Set visible 15-minute timers for each page
- **"Good enough" mindset:** "You can perfect it later, let's move on"
- **Help the room, not individuals:** If someone needs 5+ min help, get them to basic template and move on
- **Show your screen:** Live code along with participants

### Managing Two Tracks (Phase 2)
- **Set clear expectations:** "Track A is self-guided, Track B I'll help more"
- **Check in with Track A:** Quick "How's it going?" every 5 minutes
- **Support Track B:** More hands-on guidance for manual polishers
- **Celebrate both:** Both tracks are successful outcomes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Letting people perfect one page too long  
✅ "Save perfection for after the workshop"

❌ Troubleshooting individual AI issues  
✅ "Let's get your manual version working first"

❌ Explaining every HTML/CSS detail  
✅ "You can learn the code later, let's get your content in"

❌ Skipping the checkpoint  
✅ "Everyone should have 3 working pages before we move to enhancements"

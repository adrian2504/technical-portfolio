## Instructor Management Tips

### Keep Everyone Moving Together
- **Set 15-minute timers** for each page
- **"Good enough" mindset** - polish comes later
- **Help the room, not individuals** - if someone needs 5+ min help, move them to basic template completion

### Handle Mixed Skill Levels
- **Beginners:** Focus on content replacement only
- **Q Developer users:** Let them enhance content while others catch up
- **GitHub users:** They can work in repo but follow same timeline

### Common 90-Minute Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Letting people perfect one page too long  
✅ "Save perfection for after the workshop"

❌ Troubleshooting individual setups  
✅ "Let's get you working with the basic template"

❌ Explaining every HTML/CSS detail  
✅ "You can learn the code later, let's get your content in"
